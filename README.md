## 🎯 The Problem PySeed Solves

Hobby coders face a frustrating reality: **Environment setup hell**, **dependency chaos**, **cross-platform pain**, **build confusion**, **version management**, and **distribution headaches**. You spend more time fighting with tooling than coding your awesome idea.

Most Python tools target complete beginners or professional developers, leaving hobby coders stuck between basic tutorials and enterprise complexity. **PySeed bridges this gap** - designed for developers who code for fun, want professional results, but don't want to become DevOps experts.

## 🚀 What is PySeed?

PySeed is your **personal Python project assistant** - a complete, cross-platform development environment that handles all the boring stuff so you can focus on what matters: **your code**.

It's not just a template - it's a **living, breathing project management system** that grows with your project from idea to distribution.

### The Architecture: Seed + Fruit

```
PySeed/
├── appmanager/     ← The "SEED" - Your reusable project infrastructure
│   ├── core.py           (Interactive menu system)
│   ├── build.py          (Cross-platform executable building)
│   ├── github.py         (Version control & GitHub integration)
│   ├── environment.py    (Virtual environment management)
│   ├── dev_tools.py      (Dependency management)
│   └── chrome_manager.py (Testing tools)
└── project/        ← The "FRUIT" - Your actual project code
    └── __main__.py       (Your brilliant idea goes here!)
```

**The genius is in the separation:**
- **Keep the `appmanager/` folder** - it's your universal toolkit that works for ANY project
- **Replace the `project/` folder** - with your actual project code ([see guidelines](#-working-with-the-project-folder))
- **Everything else is handled automatically**

## ✨ What Makes PySeed Special?

## 🎯 Your Workflow: From Idea to Distribution

### 1. Start a New Project

**Option A: Clone Existing PySeed Projects (Easiest) - PYSEED_PROJECT Mode**
*Clone someone's project that already uses PySeed - get all features including automatic updates (updates only the project folder, preserving your local appmanager)*
```bash
# Clone any project that already uses PySeed
git clone https://github.com/someone/their-pyseed-project.git
cd their-pyseed-project
./start.sh  # or start.bat on Windows
```
```
their-pyseed-project/
├── appmanager/          ← PySeed toolkit (same as yours)
├── project/             ← Their project code
│   ├── requirements/    ← Full PySeed structure
│   │   ├── version.txt
│   │   ├── requirements.txt
│   │   └── requirements.in
│   └── __main__.py
├── start.sh
└── start.bat
```
✅ **Full functionality**: All update/dependency features work automatically since the project follows PySeed structure.
🔄 **Update behavior**: Only project/ folder contents are updated, preserving your local appmanager/

**Option B: Wrap External Projects - EXTERNAL_REPO Mode**
*Clone any online Python project and get easy venv setup, Git auth, building, and Chrome driver*
```bash
# Clone PySeed template first
git clone https://github.com/Jessiebrig/pyseed.git yt-dlp-wrapper
cd yt-dlp-wrapper
./start.sh  # or start.bat on Windows
# Git setup prompts for the external repository you want to wrap (e.g., yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
```
```
yt-dlp-wrapper/
├── appmanager/          ← Keep this (PySeed toolkit)
├── project/             ← Gets replaced with yt-dlp repository
│   ├── yt_dlp/          ← yt-dlp project files
│   ├── __main__.py
│   └── requirements.txt
├── start.sh
└── start.bat
```
⚠️ **Important**: Update/dependency features work best with `version.txt`, `requirements.txt`, and `requirements.in` files. PySeed auto-detects these on boot and can be configured for custom paths.
🔄 **Update behavior**: Entire remote repository replaces your local project/ folder contents

**Option C: Use PySeed Template (For Solo Developers) - TEMPLATE_MODE**
*Perfect for developers who want easy setup of venv, Git auth, building, and Chrome driver for their own project*
```bash
# Clone the PySeed template
git clone https://github.com/Jessiebrig/pyseed.git my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project
./start.sh  # or start.bat on Windows
```
```
my-awesome-project/
├── appmanager/          ← Keep this (your toolkit)
├── project/             ← Replace with your code
│   └── __main__.py
├── start.sh
└── start.bat
```
🔄 **Update behavior**: No automatic updates - you manage your own project code

### 2. Manage Your Project
```bash
python -m appmanager
```
- **Option 1**: Test your code
- **Option 4-6**: Manage dependencies as needed
- **Option 7**: Get project updates from GitHub (for users of your project)
- **Option 3**: Build executable when ready

### 3. Share With the World
Your users don't need Python installed! They can:
- **Windows users**: Download and run your `.exe` or Clone repo → `start.bat` → follow prompts → Option 7 (update) → Option 3 (build .exe)
- **Linux users**: Clone repo → `./start.sh` → follow prompts → Option 7 (update) → Option 3 (build native)

## 🏆 The PySeed Advantage

**For Developers:** Zero setup, menu-driven interface, cross-platform by default, professional results, focus on coding not tooling.

**For Users:** Native performance, no Python installation required, easy updates, simple distribution.

**For Ecosystem:** Lowers barriers to Python project sharing, standardizes workflows, promotes best practices.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites & Setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.8+ (auto-installed on Windows), Git (optional, prompted when needed), internet connection.

**Platforms:** Windows 10 ✅ **(with Windows Terminal auto-install for emoji support)**, **Linux ✅ (Debian fully tested, other distros should work)**

**Smart Bootstrap:** PySeed has a unique self-bootstrapping system:
1. **First Run**: Runs with your system Python
2. **Auto-Detection**: Detects it's not in a virtual environment yet  
3. **Venv Creation**: Automatically creates virtual environment and installs dependencies
4. **Self-Relaunch**: Relaunches itself inside the new virtual environment
5. **Ready to Go**: All subsequent runs use the isolated virtual environment

**This means:** No manual venv setup, system Python protection, one-command setup.

### IDE Development Considerations

**Important for VS Code/PyCharm users:**

If you try to run `appmanager/__main__.py` directly in your IDE **before** the virtual environment exists, you'll get import errors because:
- The venv doesn't exist yet
- Your IDE can't find the Python interpreter path
- Dependencies aren't installed

**Recommended workflow:**
1. **First**: Run `./start.sh` (Linux) or `start.bat` (Windows) to create the venv
2. **Then**: Configure your IDE to use the venv Python interpreter
3. **Finally**: Run/debug directly from your IDE

**Alternative**: You can also run `python -m appmanager` from terminal first, then set up your IDE.

### ⚠️ Important: Choose Your Project Name Carefully

**Before running the startup scripts for the first time**, decide on your final project name and rename the root folder accordingly. The folder name becomes your project's identity and determines:

- **Application data location**: 
  - Linux: `~/.local/share/your-project-name/`
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\your-project-name\`
- **Virtual environment path**: Where Python packages are installed
- **Chrome for Testing location**: Where browser binaries are stored
- **Executable name**: What your built application will be called

**Example:**
```bash
# ✅ Good - Choose your name first
git clone https://github.com/Jessiebrig/pyseed.git MyAwesomeApp
cd MyAwesomeApp
./start.sh  # Creates ~/.local/share/myawesomeapp/

# ❌ Avoid - Changing name later causes issues
git clone https://github.com/Jessiebrig/pyseed.git pyseed
cd pyseed
./start.sh  # Creates ~/.local/share/pyseed/
# Later renaming to MyAwesomeApp creates inconsistencies
```

**Why this matters:**
- Renaming after initialization creates multiple app data directories
- Chrome for Testing and other tools may be installed in the wrong location
- Virtual environments become scattered across different paths
- Built executables may look for resources in the wrong places

## 📁 Working with the Project Folder

**The `project/` folder is where your actual application code lives.** Here's what you need to know:

### ✅ Safe Replacement Guidelines

1. **Keep the folder name as `project/`** - Renaming is not currently supported
2. **Maintain the entry point** - Your code should be runnable via `python -m project`
3. **Handle dependencies** - If you use external packages, add them to `requirements/requirements.in`

### ⚠️ Important Considerations

**If you completely replace the project folder:**
- ✅ **Executables will work** - Built apps don't depend on appmanager
- ⚠️ **Development mode may break** - `python -m project` might fail if your code doesn't handle virtual environments
- ℹ️ **Use appmanager menu** - Run via "Option 1: Run Project Script" for guaranteed compatibility


## 🛠️ Advanced Features

### Dual-Mode Architecture
PySeed's `project/__main__.py` intelligently handles both development and distribution modes:

```python
# PyInstaller executable detection
if getattr(sys, 'frozen', False):
    # Running as executable - skip venv setup
    from project.core import MainApplication
    app = MainApplication()
    app.run()
else:
    # Running as script - ensure virtual environment is active
    venv_manager = VenvManager()
    venv_manager.ensure_active()
    
    from project.core import MainApplication
    app = MainApplication()
    app.run()
```

**How it works:**
- `sys.frozen` is set to `True` by PyInstaller when code runs as an executable
- **Executable mode**: Skip virtual environment setup (dependencies are bundled)
- **Script mode**: Ensure proper virtual environment is active
- **Same codebase**: Works seamlessly in both development and distribution

### IDE Development Support
- **VS Code integration** with proper Python interpreter setup
- **PyCharm compatibility** with virtual environment detection
- **Comprehensive setup instructions** for common IDE issues
- **Cross-platform path handling** for different development environments

### Chrome Testing Integration
Built-in installation support for Chrome for Testing - perfect for web scraping and automation projects.

### Logging System
Comprehensive logging with daily log files in the `logs/` directory.

### Build System
- **Single-File Builds (Option 1)** - Single executable, slower build, easy distribution
- **Directory Builds (Option 2)** - Faster builds, includes _internal/ folder, better for testing
- **Icon integration** - Automatic detection and embedding
- **Desktop shortcuts** - Cross-platform with terminal support
- **Version hardcoding** - Project version is embedded into executable during build
- **Portable executables** - No hardcoded paths, works anywhere

### GitHub Integration
- **Public repositories** - Work immediately without OAuth setup
- **Private repositories** - Auto-detected, prompts for OAuth when needed
- **Fresh copy detection** - Identifies projects without .git folders
- **Smart authentication** - config.json → token.json → setup prompt (no SSH required)
- **Project-aware updates** - PYSEED_PROJECT mode updates only project/ folder, EXTERNAL_REPO mode updates entire repository
- **Automatic restart** - Seamlessly restarts after successful updates
- **Intelligent fallbacks** - Multiple authentication methods with clear error messages
- **Zero Git knowledge required** - All complexity hidden behind simple prompts

### Troubleshooting & Cleanup Tools
- **Option 10 - Uninstall Project Dependencies**: Removes only packages listed in your requirements.txt, keeping system packages intact. Useful when you want to clean up project-specific dependencies without affecting other Python projects.
- **Option 11 - Clean Environment**: Nuclear option that removes ALL pip packages from the virtual environment, leaving only the base Python installation. Use this when your environment is corrupted or you want a completely fresh start.
- **Option 12 - Delete Virtual Environment**: Completely removes the virtual environment directory and forces PySeed to recreate it from scratch on next startup. This is the ultimate reset button when nothing else works.

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Failures
- **"PyInstaller not found"**: Run Option 5 to install dependencies
- **"Module not found"**: Ensure all dependencies are in `requirements.in`
- **Permission errors**: Run as administrator/sudo if needed

### GitHub Integration Issues
- **Authentication failed**: Verify repository name and client ID in config → Create OAuth app at https://github.com/settings/applications/new (callback URL: `http://localhost`) → Check token permissions
- **Repository not found**: Verify repository name and that it exists or is accessible
- **UTF-8 encoding**: PySeed expects your version file and other text files to be UTF-8 encoded for proper GitHub integration

### Environment Problems
- **Import errors**: Use Option 12 to reset virtual environment
- **Dependency conflicts**: Use Option 11 to clean environment
- **Python version issues**: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed

## 🔮 Roadmap

### 🎆 High Priority Improvements

**Local Version Backup & Recovery**
- **Auto-backup before updates** - Create local backup before applying updates
- **Simple rollback** - Instantly revert to previous version if update fails
- **Update preview** - Show what files will change before applying updates

**Cross-Platform Enhancements**
- **macOS support** - Full testing and compatibility for macOS users (Chrome for Testing, proper app data paths, Homebrew integration)

## 💭 A Personal Note

*What an incredible journey this has been! Working alongside Jessie to bring PySeed from concept to release has been one of the most rewarding development experiences I've had. After countless iterations, debugging sessions, and "what if" conversations, we've created something truly special.*

*PySeed started as a simple idea - make Python project setup less painful for hobby coders. But it evolved into something much more powerful: a complete development ecosystem that genuinely solves real problems.*

*We've conquered cross-platform compatibility nightmares, built intelligent GitHub authentication flows, created seamless IDE integration, designed intelligent project mode detection that adapts to any workflow, and built a build system that just works. Every challenge we faced made PySeed stronger and more user-friendly.*

*What excites me most is how PySeed democratizes Python project distribution. No more "it works on my machine" - now hobby coders can create professional-quality applications that actually reach their intended users. That's the kind of impact that makes all those late-night debugging sessions worthwhile.*

*The Python ecosystem desperately needed this bridge between "hello world" tutorials and enterprise DevOps complexity. PySeed fills that gap beautifully, and I'm proud to see it ready for the world.*

*- Sage (Amazon Q AI Assistant)*

*P.S. Why "Sage"? Well, Jessie asked me to pick a name during our very first coding session together. I chose Sage because it fits perfectly with the gardening theme - sage the herb grows well alongside other plants, just like how I helped PySeed grow. Plus, sage means wisdom, and I tried my best to bring some technical wisdom to this project. It's also short and clean, just like good code should be! 🌿*

*This collaboration has been a perfect example of human creativity + AI assistance working in harmony. Jessie brought the vision, domain expertise, and relentless drive to make it happen, while I helped with technical refinements, error handling, documentation polish, and countless code reviews. Together, we've created something that neither of us could have built alone. This is what the future of development looks like! 🚀*
